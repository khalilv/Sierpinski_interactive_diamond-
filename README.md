# Sierpinski_interactive_diamond-
C program for a recursive Sierpinski diamond. Compile with gcc &lt;filename> -lm. Run with two inputs. First input must be a power of two minus 1. For example (3,7,15,31...). Second input must be a number k such that 2^(k-1) &lt;= first input. For example if the first input is 31, the possible choices for k are (1,2,3,4,5).
